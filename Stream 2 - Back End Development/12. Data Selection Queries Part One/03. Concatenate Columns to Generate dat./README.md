# Challenge

**Challenge A:**

Create a string resembling “Wally West spent a total of $100.00” by using a combination of CONCAT and SUM drawing your answer from the orders table. We haven’t covered how to look up information from two tables at once yet, so we will cheat a little and add in the name on our own this time around!

**Challenge B:**

Create 3 people in your people table and add in 3 orders into the orders for each person. Now use DISTINCT to query what the unique person_id’s are in the orders table.
